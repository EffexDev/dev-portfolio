<h4>I built this as a resume piece. What good is it being able to make pretty things if all is yields is a line in a pdf file that no one reads?</h4>

<p>I started in tech like a lot of people do these days, super young and really wanting to build a gaming PC. This evolved into working in tech fields for a good chunk of my adult career. I started in an assistant role as a "tech support" for a good family friends electrical engineering company
  then transitioned with him into live broadcast. From there I took a brief hiatus and worked as a sewing machinist at Supafit seat covers.

  Things really started moving when I started working at Aussie Broadband in 2022. This allowed me to work on my development skills with Autohotkey which taught me functional programming. After a couple of years I moved over to a role at Aussie's fighter brand, Buddy Telco.
  This allowed me to work more on mainstream programming languages and ignited my passion for web development
